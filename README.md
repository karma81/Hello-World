Hello World,

I would like to start by saying how crazy this is, never in a million years would I have thought I would be here trying to learn coding and here I am, a late bloomer but yet eager to learn. I love to travel, eat and spend time with my family, did I say I love to eat, jajaja. I write/speak Spanglish MUCHO that sometimes I don't even know what I'm saying, jejeje. That's it for now, à tout à l'heure!!!
